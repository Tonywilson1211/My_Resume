                    In my search for a new challenge where I can leverage my skills and experience in software development, 
                    I was pleased to find Appleâ€™s opening for the UK Software Engineering Apprenticeship. 

                    I have nearly  two decades of professional experience behind me and have recently discovered my passion for software development. 
                    Becoming a software developer has become my goal and I am currently a full time student with Code Institute, an online remote learning 
                    bootcamp, specilising in full stack software development. I am on track to receive a university accredited diploma in coming months. 

                    In a short space of time I have developed projects utilising HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. 
                    I have also taken an active part in 2 Hackathons where I have been able to demonstrate my ability to work as part of a team,  
                    apply my knowledge and learn the importance of version control via Github.
